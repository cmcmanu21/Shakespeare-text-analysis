### Shakespeare-text-analysis

This was created as a Result of Chase Romano's Visual Analytics Course at UNC Charlotte's School of Data Science. I was given several screenshots of a shinyapp, and told to recreate them with my own code. The goal of this app is to be able to analyze the word count in three of Shakespeare's plays through a word cloud and word count chart. In the word cloud tab, viewers have an interactive dropdown menu that allows them to select one of three plays. Secondly, there is a checkbox labeled "stop words" that removes the stop words from the count, and an action button to run the app. Finally, there are interactive sliders that allow the viewer to change the max number of words, or change the size of the largest and smallest words in the cloud. In the words counts tab, viewes have access to the same sliders and drop down menu, however only the bottom two sliders are able to adjust the output in the chart by minumum word count and word size.
